      <h2>Monthly Cost of Living</h2>
      <p>The average wage for a single person living in British Columbia is $4,420 per month, equivalent to $26 an hour. Accounting for the average costs of rent for a one-bedroom apartment, food, water, heating, and electricity, an individual would need to allocate between $2,500 and $4,000 per month. This would leave them with a disposable income of around $1,920—or possibly even less, as is often the case. For the average person, this amount may be sufficient.</p>
      <p>Expenses for entertainment and leisure could include activities such as watching movies through a streaming service (costing $7.99 per month with ads), exercising with a gym membership (ranging from $50 to $150), dining out (approximately $200 per month if done weekly), and engaging in free activities such as visiting the library, hiking, and more.
</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, many people struggle to survive on an average income, living in increasingly difficult conditions due to financial constraints. For those who live in comfort—even relative comfort—it can be difficult to imagine experiencing economic hardship. The wealth people possess, however modest, creates a protective bubble that often makes them unaware of the struggles faced by others.
</p>
      <p>As of June 1, 2024, the minimum wage in British Columbia is $17.40 per hour, an increase of $0.35 from the previous rate of $16.75. Pairing this with the standard 40-hour workweek, a person earning minimum wage would have a monthly income of $2,784.
</p>
      <p>In the best-case scenario, they would be able to cover all of their basic living expenses with little to no money left over. However, even in this scenario, the lowest estimated monthly cost of living would still leave them several hundred dollars short. These financial deficiencies make it difficult to afford necessities such as water, heating, and electricity—basic resources that many take for granted.</p>
      <p>For those in such financial situations, the issue is no longer about choosing cheaper brands of snacks or cutting back on dining out. Instead, it becomes a question of whether to prioritize heating or food. It is no longer a matter of needs versus wants but rather a choice between two essential needs—deciding which is more critical for survival.
</p>
      <p>With less money to spend, quality of life declines significantly. Many are forced to live in small, cramped studio apartments, especially in expensive cities like Vancouver.
</p>
      <p>Another crucial factor to consider is temperature. While heating costs may not seem urgent in the summer, they become a major concern during the winter—especially for those who must choose between heating and other necessities. Managing a budget wisely in such conditions is extremely challenging.
</p>
      <p>There is also a stark difference between healthy, high-quality food—which is often unaffordable for those with limited budgets—and cheap, unhealthy alternatives that lack essential nutrients. Quick and inexpensive meals, commonly relied upon by individuals who either cannot cook or lack the funds for healthier options, tend to be nutrient-poor and high in calories. While the connection may not be direct, studies have shown that limited financial resources for food can increase the risk of obesity.
</p>
      <p>Ironically, people living in poverty often end up spending more money in the long run than those with financial stability.
</p>
      <p>For example, someone with a larger budget might invest in a Costco membership, allowing them to buy food in bulk and ultimately spend less on groceries each month. On the other hand, an individual without a Costco membership must shop at regular stores, where food is not sold in bulk. As a result, they end up spending more money overall—despite purchasing the same amount of food. This is just one of many ways economic inequality impacts daily life.
</p>
      <p>Poverty is defined as a state in which an individual lacks the financial resources necessary for a basic standard of living. Those living in poverty experience hardships unimaginable to those in relative comfort. Instead of being viewed as human beings struggling due to financial circumstances, they are often unfairly labeled as lazy, unmotivated burdens on society.
</p>
      <p>This is why education on economic inequality is crucial—especially for those unaware of its effects. A broader understanding of these issues can foster greater empathy and awareness, helping to bridge the gap between those who struggle and those who live in comfort.
