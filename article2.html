      <h2>Social Class Perception</h2>
      <p>Social classes have often been tied in with economic inequality in many areas of the world, no matter where you are. However the intensity could vary dramatically depending on the country you live you( huge difference between LICs(Low income countries) and HICs(High income countries).) In this paper, I will help you understand social classes and economic inequality and telling you how these two are related to each other. It is important, however, that the classes we are talking about are strictly economic disparities and not about caste or race, although these also play a huge role, there are many exceptions to this, like during the French Revolution, where even though the nobility have more influence when compared to the Third Estate, many members in the Third Estate, primarily lawyers and merchants are often richer than many nobles at Versailles through their hard work.
</p>
      <p>Firstly, it is important to note that terms we use to quantify economic inequality like the poverty line is relative based on the country assessed as LIC’s tend to have a lower income threshold than HIC’s. This could be because of differences in minimum wage or because of varying needs amongst the population, which could increase or decrease based on demand. For example, rural dwellings often have a lower cost of living when compared to many urban residents because they are more community focused due to a smaller population, so prices would generally be more reasonable to the average Joe. In addition, people’s needs are less in rural areas due to the fact that they own farms, which helps mitigate some food costs, as they just needed to buy the things they don’t have in comparison to a resident in a bustling urban city, which would have to pay things such as rent, car insurances, credit card and entertainment fees(movie tickets, amusement parks etc.), all of which seem unimaginable for the average rural dwelling. In LIC’s, the income distribution varies a lot more than those in HIC’s. While a homeless man in Vancouver’s Downtown East side could afford a tent and perhaps a few luxuries like drugs or alcohol, with support from the Government in the form of Universal basic income and homeless shelters, someone on the same level of poverty in a country like Nigeria is often ignored by the government and forced into built-up communities, like Makoko in Lagos, Nigeria, which often does not have basic amenities like running water or electricity and would almost certainly not have the same amount of income as even the poorest Vancouverite seems wealthier in comparison. This is not to say that people here are not struggling, as people from both sides have their own vices and problems that they will have to deal with.</p>
      <p>Social classes are often divided into 3 main classes-upper, middle and lower classes. However, there is a huge range within each of these classes. For example, the term’ lower class’ is used to describe a wide variety of people, from people who could hardly pay their bills living in a small apartment, to people who couldn’t even get things like reliable food, clean water and a warm shelter everyday. I will simplify things by dividing each class into several groups, to help people better understand where they lie on the ’socioeconomic pyramid.’</p>
      <p>The lower class is divided into several groups, like being homeless or unemployed (could not afford a home or necessities.), the working poor and the single parent household. These groups are all clustered together because they hardly earn enough money to pay the bills and are often looked down upon by society as they often do unskilled labour, like retail or food service for very little pay or in the case of the homeless, seen as a nuisance on the streets as they go around all day without doing anything.  These people often work(if they do work) in many unskilled jobs, however, with the social stigma against these people, less opportunities will arise as less and less businesses will want to hire people like this, causing a gap in profits as the businesses will try to replace these with teenagers, who put less importance on the task than people who often have years of experience in these jobs, despite the disparity in living conditions, these businesses, from the simple mcdonalds to a fancy new bubble tea shop would benefit from the employment of the  lower class .
</p>
      <p>The middle class is often well educated and aspiring to go to university. They also have more money than the lower class allowing them to partake in extra-curricular activities like badminton or drawing classes. There are two different distinctions of middle class- lower middle class and upper middle class. Middle class people own property and work in high paying jobs like doctors and lawyers, however this isn’t as prevalent when applied to the lower middle class due to a lower amount of opportunities and amount of wealth in terms of assets or jobs, which would lead to lower middle class families living a decent life but perhaps not an ‘ideal’ life in terms of being successful- owning a house for example is virtually impossible for someone in Vancouver in the lower middle class, with many families living in apartments or townhouses as these are cheaper than single family homes, and even then they will have to pay a large portion of money in terms of mortgage. Upper middle class people on the other hand, often own sizeable portions of real estate, stocks and other investments to accumulate more money and aren’t as burdened by taxes, interest fees(on cars for example) and food( like going out to restaurants more often.) They are separated from the lower class however simply due to the fact that they have a bit of money left over, which could be used for things like extracurriculars and material possessions, which people in the lowest socioeconomic division could not afford as they are just barely managing to get by with the amount of money they receive as many poor people are working paycheck to paycheck to just pay the bills.</p>
      <p>The Upper class often works in high paying white collar jobs like CEOs and Board members. While most still go to university, they are not in need of it like the middle class as they have plenty of money to spare for many luxuries like a Ferrari or Gucci clothes and because of generational wealth passed down from wealthy family members. The difference between the upper middle class and the upper class is that the upper middle class has to work harder in order to get the same standard of living as a wealthy entrepreneur in the upper class, even if the person is a successful doctor or lawyer, whether as if you were a successful entrepreneur then you will have less on your plate and more money overall with the same quality of life.
</p>
      <p>The relationship between Economic Inequality, life circumstances and social class is often much like that of a positive feedback loop in where the worse your circumstances are, the less likely you will earn more money in the future and therefore a smaller probability will arise in where you will get into a higher social class. An example to illustrate this could be between a white and a black man in Mississippi in the 1970s As the white person grows up, he ends up having more opportunities due to having a better education, allowing him to climb up the social ladder while the black person has less opportunities in part because of racism and would thereby be less educated due to the hindrances imposed by the government, having less of a chance to rise up and a greater chance of just staying where he is or decreasing in position. These are prevalent even today, where most of the discriminatory ‘Jim Crow laws’ are not present anymore, as social class divisions occur all around the world, like in banks, where a teller is less likely to give a loan to someone who ‘dresses poorly’ compared to a more well off person, blocking off many opportunities for those less fortunate.
